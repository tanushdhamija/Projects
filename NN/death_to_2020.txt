Death to 2020 was alright.. No "lol"s but I did smile. Jokes seemed a little forced. In the first 30-40 minutes they covered various topics of 2020. After that it became all about US politics and was super boring. Got ruined. Last 15 minutes I was just playing it in the background and browsing my phone.
