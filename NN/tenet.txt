I feel it’s actually not about understanding it or the concepts of physics and time. Inception dealt with some really grand ideas. So did Interstellar. The only difference is that they were in the subtext, the story was about one man and his family in both the films, so what happens there is the “story” becomes universal and even though most of the technical stuff is not entirely understood you are left with a feeling that you’ve watched a good film and a good story. The problem with this film is that, at least I felt that he’s taking the audio for granted. Even now if I ask people about the mechanics of limbo and rules of dreaming in the inception verse they’ll stutter, but everyone likes the film, because the film wasn’t about dreaming and limbos and other technical stuff of that universe. There was just no heart or a story in this one. It just made me feel alienated the whole time. A movie should make you think and feel. It should at least do one of those things effectively while trying it’s best to do the other. Tenet tries to do the thinking part and fails, and it doesn’t even try the feel part. Definitely the worst Nolan film for me. 😅🙏🏻 that last part that you mentioned? That should’ve been the whole movie. I liked those few minutes better than those 2.5 hours.
