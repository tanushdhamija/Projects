My emotions in the first ten minutes were slightly scattered: initially, I was worried that the style was not something that aligned with my personal take on films, meandering and stalling for plot development. However, one line (and everyone who has seen this film will know which line I mean) completely flipped the film, both emotionally and narratively. Suddenly, the focus is clarified, an inside view (albeit hypothetical) of how some of the 60s' biggest names acted, felt and argued. The cast is top notch: Kingsley Ben-Adir and Leslie Odom Jr. (Malcolm X and Same Cooke) are the standouts, perfecting nuances and subtle traits of both their characters. They are the people to deliver the emotional weight, whilst Eli Goree and Aldis Hodge (Cassius Clay and Jim Brown) are more the foils for this conversation. One issue some people may have is the plot's lack of direction; I can see what director Regina King was trying to channel, but at points it feels without direction. There is also an outside influence hinted at, but this feels like a forgotten plot point by the conclusion. The music and set design is excellent (Odom Jr's singing is typically great), and I can't say I didn't enjoy this movie, but I still feel like there was one crucial element missing.
